# lgplus-client

*An LFE Google+ Client Library*

## Introduction

This is a placeholder until Google opens up status updates in in API. (Right
now, they only let partner companies post via APIs.)


## Installation

Just add it to your ``rebar.config`` deps:

```erlang
  {deps, [
    ...
    {lgplus-client, ".*",
      {git, "git@github.com:YOURNAME/lgplus-client.git", "master"}}
      ]}.
```

And then do the usual:

```bash
    $ rebar get-deps
    $ rebar compile
```
